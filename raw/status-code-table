   the program.
  {sp arguments} may be the placeholder name of the missing arguments.
4 [<option>: ]too many arguments[: <n>]

  {sp relational_opt} may be the four relational operators: {c <=}, {c <}, {c >}
   or {c >=}
  {sp limit} may either be the minimum, floor, maximum or ceiling value.
12 [<option>: ]<argument>: does not match: <pattern>
  The argument does not match the pattern provided. The pattern can be {p glob},
   {p regex} or any other pattern matching system.
