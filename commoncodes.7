.SH NAME
CommonCodes \- Standardized list of commonly used exit statuses

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B CommonCodes
is an attempt to standardize the meaning of exit statuses of programs written
for
.B Unix
like systems.

.B CommonCodes
includes the 15 exit codes defined by
.B BSD
in 
.I sysexits.h
that range from 64 to 78.

.B GNU
.B Bash
uses the exit status 2 to indicate incorrect usage of shell builtins.
.B Bash
also uses codes above 125 for special exit statuses like termination by a sent
signal.
.br
.B CommonCodes
adopts both of these rules, using 2 as a generic usage error and not defining
any codes above 125.

If you're going to use the
.B CommonCodes
standard in your program, be sure to document it. A good place would be both the
.I --help
summary and the programs manpage.
.br
It is recommended to always add which exact version is being used.

Some ranges have been kept empty so that developers may add error messages of
their own, tailored to the program that they are writing.
.br
If statuses in these ranges are defined then they should always be documented.
Again in the
.I --help
summary and in the manpage.

In the following table, these rules apply for the messages:
.IP \[bu] 2
Italic and/or underlined symbols are placeholders for other text that should
get replaced for real messages.
.IP \[bu]
Text and symbols in bold square brackets may be ommitted in real messages.
.IP \[bu]
Text and symbols followed by bold ellipsis may be repeated one or more times in
real messages.
.IP \[bu]
In real messages, only one field of text and symbols may be displayed if they
are separated by bold vertical bars(\c
.BI | \c
).

Some status messages have the suffix
.bir "[" "" ": " "" "info" "" "]" " "
appendend to them and a lot of usage errors about arguments also contain the
placeholder
.bir "" "option" "."
.br
.I "info"
may be more information on what the error represents and why it happened.
.br
.I "option"
may be either a
.B "POSIX"
short option or a
.B "GNU"
long option, if that option received the argument that is invalid except the
program itself.

.SH FOOTNOTES
Since exit code 2 (generic usage error) and exit code 64 (command line usage
error) are basically the same, it is recommended to use code 2 when distributing
for
.B GNU/Linux
systems and code 64 when distributing for
.B BSD
systems.
