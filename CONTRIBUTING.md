# How To Contribute to CommonCodes #

Thanks for taking the time to contribute to this project!

In this short document you're going to read how to report bugs or errors,
request new features or other changes and how to contribute to the source files!

## Reports and Requests ##

If you want to submit a bug or other error report or want to suggest a new
feature or some other change, then you can do so by [creating a new issue][new_issue].

But before you do, make sure that...

* There isn't already a issue open for this specific (or similiar)
  problem/request
* The feature you want to request is appropriate

If all of those points apply to your report/request, then please open a new
issue and help improve **CommonCodes**!

If you don't wanna wait for someone to fix the problem you have, or to implement
the new feature, you can just do it yourself!

First, though, go through this list of important bullet points:

* The main and only language this project uses is English, be sure that you can
